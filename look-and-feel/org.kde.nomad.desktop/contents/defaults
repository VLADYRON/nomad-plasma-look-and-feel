# Bug 382731 - kcm_lookandfeel doesn't apply Aurorae theme
# The Look and Feel KCM doesn't apply the Aurorae theme that's specified in the package config file.
# With the configuration below Kwin doesn't give any output, however changing the theme using X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name
# as set in the theme's metadata file kwin outputs: aurorae: Couldn't find QML Decoration "$theme" which means
# that it won't load the theme because it "can't" find it. It does seem to load Plastik with no problem so it fallsback
# to it. Closing and opening the KCM sort of refreshes Kwin output, otherwise it will still output that can't find the theme
# that was previously set even after it was changed.
